1. For each Philly census tract, calculate the number of crimes that occurred there during each year, 2009 to 2016.

This Step:
	1. R part: import the original crime data, filter null crime data, set latitude and longtitude apart and
		   export each year crime data csv for spatial join in arcmap. So I have 8 seperate csv file in this step.
	2. ArcGIS part: use the philly censuc tract to spatial join each years' crime data and export them back
		        to csv so I can do the visualization part in R. I ended up reading 8 spatial join csv files in R.

2. Visualize the crime as an animated choropleth

This Step:(all in R)
	1. merge each spatial join crime data together in one dataset
	2. ggplot2: using the merged crime data to make the gif using imageMagick and ggplot2
	3. ezgif: I also tried save 2009 and 2010 crime number map and using ezgif to create gif
